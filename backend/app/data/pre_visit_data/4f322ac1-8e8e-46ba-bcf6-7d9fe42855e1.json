    "primary_concern": "Patient reports a significant concern regarding potential hearing loss following attendance at a concert yesterday. They experienced ringing in their ears, described as painful, which has persisted throughout the day. Additionally, the patient has noticed that sounds are muffled, indicating possible temporary threshold shifts in hearing sensitivity due to the concert's loud environment.",

    "medical_history": "The patient has no known chronic conditions and reports no previous issues with hearing or ear infections. There are no documented allergies or surgical history related to the ears. The patient appears to be generally healthy and has not indicated any other significant medical concerns.",
    "ai_insights": "The symptoms described suggest a likely case of temporary threshold shift due to noise exposure at the concert, commonly referred to as temporary hearing loss or noise-induced hearing loss. The presence of tinnitus (ringing in the ears) further supports this diagnosis. It is crucial to monitor the duration of these symptoms, as prolonged ringing or worsening hearing could indicate more serious damage. A thorough audiometric evaluation is recommended to assess hearing levels and to rule out any underlying conditions. The patient should be advised about the importance of protecting their ears from loud noises in the future to prevent permanent damage.",
